This notebook is created to help lab members assign samples to extract each week.
Currently, our goal is to extract and amplify at least 6 samples from each polygon and season.
A polygon contains all samples lying within 5 km of each other, and we have 40 total polygons from Indiana
5 km is the average (roughly) estimated home range radius of Bobcats and Coyotes.
